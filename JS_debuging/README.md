## Dubeg a random Background Color Change

This is a workshop from freecodecamp JS_debuging module. here they have provided 3 files-
- index.html
- styles.css
- script.js

The task is in script.js file there has several issue. like use proper array initialization, id selection, function call etc. In terms of solving, i have face an error in getRandomIndex finding. the mistake was i retrun the getRandomIndex instead of console.log().
