# My JavaScript Learning Journey

I have been learning JavaScript through FreeCodeCamp, covering a wide range of modules and topics that have helped me build strong fundamentals and confidence in programming. Throughout my learning, I faced many challenges, but with persistence, I overcame them and gained valuable knowledge.

One of the most impactful modules for me was the **Numbers** module. It helped me understand concepts that are frequently asked in technical interviews. Initially, I was often afraid of misunderstanding the output of code during interviews, but after mastering this module, I feel more confident tackling those questions.

Below is a list of the modules I have studied as part of my JavaScript learning path, similar to a book's index:
