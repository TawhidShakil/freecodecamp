## Dubeg a random Background Color Change

This is a workshop from freecodecamp JS_debuging module. here they have provided 3 files-
- index.html
- styles.css
- script.js

## My debuging Experience

While solving the task, I encountered an issue in the `getRandomIndex()` function.  
The mistake was that I used `return getRandomIndex` instead of logging it with `console.log(getRandomIndex())`, which led to confusion while testing the output.

After identifying the problem, I corrected it by calling the function properly, and the rest of the logic worked as expected.

## Outcome

Now, when the button is clicked, the background color changes randomly to a dark shade from the provided array, and the selected hex code is displayed on the screen.
