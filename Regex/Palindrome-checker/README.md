## What is a Palindrome?

A **palindrome** is a word, number, phrase, or sequence that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).  
Examples:
- `madam`
- `racecar`
- `121`
- `Was it a car or a cat I saw`

## My Experience

During my **2nd semester at university**, I was first introduced to the concept of a palindrome in a foundational programming course. It fascinated me how such a simple concept could be implemented using basic string manipulation. This small idea sparked my interest in solving more logic-based problems and helped me improve my coding fundamentals early on.

Creating this Palindrome Checker is a way to revisit those early days and reinforce the logic behind string handling and algorithm design.
