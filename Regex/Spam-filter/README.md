# Regex Practice - Spam Filter Project (FreeCodeCamp)

## My Experience

Though I watched the videos from FreeCodeCamp, I couldnâ€™t fully grasp the concept of regular expressions (regex) at first. Then, I watched a YouTube video on the same topic, which helped me understand a bit more, but still left some confusion.

However, when I attempted the **Spam Filter Project** in this module, things started to click. By building the spam filter step-by-step and experimenting with different regex patterns, I finally started to understand how powerful and flexible regular expressions can be. Now I feel much more confident with regex and its real-world use cases.

## What I Learned

### How to Match Patterns

- **Match characters**: `[aeiou]` matches any single vowel.
- **Match digits**: `[0-9]` matches any single digit.
- **Case-insensitive match**: Use the `i` flag. Example: `/hello/i` matches "Hello", "HELLO", or "hello".
- **Word boundaries**: Use `(?:^|\s)` to match the beginning of a word and `(?:$|\s)` for the end.

#### Example:
```js
const vowelRegex = /[aeiou]/gi;
"Hello World".match(vowelRegex); // ['e', 'o', 'o']

```
**.replace()**

```js

const str = "fr33 m0n3y";
const clean = str.replace(/[30]/g, 'e');
console.log(clean);'

```
**Optional Matching**

```js

const colorRegex = /colou?r/;
colorRegex.test("color");

```
